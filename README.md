#Individual-Part-README

List of API’s Incorporated:
1.	Flickr API
2.	Wikipedia API


For the individual part of this project. I have decided to incorporate the Flickr API and Wikipedia API in the bot we initially worked in as a group. I chose the Flickr API to give the bot the ability to search on specific tags based on the conversation I am conducting with the bot. Ultimately returning a relevant response. We can see that in the video I have attached, the bot returns and image of a shoe when the word ‘shoe’ is mentioned in a conversation with the bot. 

The Wikipedia API was used to add more knowledge and information to the interaction between the user and the bot. When asking questions that includes “what is..”, the bot will be able to extract information from Wikipedia to be able to formulate a relevant response, this is apparent in the video I have attached.
